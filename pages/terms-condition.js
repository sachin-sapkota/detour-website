                    information to a third party where we believe, in good
                    faith, that it is desirable to do so for the purposes of a
                    civil action, criminal investigation, or other legal matter.

                    opportunity to file a motion to quash the subpoena, or we

                    release your information to, third parties where we believe
                    that it is prudent to do so for legal reasons, such as our
                    belief that you have engaged in fraudulent activities. You
                    release us from any damages that may arise from or relate to
                    the release of your information to a request from law
